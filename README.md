# App-PFT

PFT stands for *Plain F. Text*, where the meaning of *F.* is up to
personal interpretation. Like *Fancy* or *Fantastic*.

It is yet another static website generator. This means your content is
compiled once and the result can be served by a simple HTTP server,
without need of server-side dynamic content generation.

This project provides the command line tools needed for managing the blog
and compile it in web pages. It uses the library called
[PFT](https://github.com/dacav/pft) in order to obtain an abstraction over
the file system access.
