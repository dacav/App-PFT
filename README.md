# App-PFT

PFT stands for *Plain F. Text*, where the meaning of *F.* is up to
personal interpretation. Like *Fancy* or *Fantastic*.

It is yet another static website generator. This means your content is
compiled once and the result can be served by a simple HTTP server,
without need of server-side dynamic content generation.

I started it from scratch, both because as I was not entirely satisfied
with the ones I tried, and because I wanted to learn another language
(Perl) with a side project. While writing it I got inspired by
the *App::Dapper* project.
